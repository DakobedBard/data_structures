Network Flow.  

Several graph problems we have discussed in this book can be solved using network flow, including bipartite matching, shortest path, and edge/vetex connectivity.  

The key to exploiting this power is recognizing that your problem can be moeled as network flow.  


Implementations.  High performane codes for both maximum fow and minimum cost flow were

GOBLIN (http://www.math.uni-augsburg.de/âˆ¼fremuth/goblin.html) is an ex-
tensive C++ library dealing with all of the standard graph optimization problems,
including several different algorithms for both maximum flow and minimum-cost
flow.
