In this file we will have implemnetations of Kruskall and Prim...

Kruskal's algorithm is an alternate approach to finding minimum spanning trees that prove more efficient on sparse graphs.  Like Prim, Kruskals algorithm is greedy.  Unlike Prim, it does not start with a particular vertex.  Kruskal's algorithm builds up connected components of vertices, culminating in the minimum spanning tree.  Initially, each vertex forms its own seperate component in the tree-to-be.  The algorithm repeatedly considers the lightest remaining edge and tests whether its two end points lie within the same connected component.
