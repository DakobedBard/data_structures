Worked on the priority queue implementation.. took a working implementation possibly from GeeksForGeeks for ints and wrote to work with templates.  

- Decreaase Key... 
-Priority Queue
	-THis should be high priority since a lot of other algorithms depend on this..

Exception Safety?? 



SetUp the test framework.... 

having problems with seg faults of course on my heap.  

haing problems seg faults with the DFS... god damit 

Disjoint Set Union Find
- Implement cycle detection using UnionFind


Binary Search Tree:
- implement remove..		This is quite involved infact due to the numbe of 


Linked Lists...

- I inserted Values into the linked List
- Write a deletion method 
- Merge Lists... 
- Reverse Lists .. 
- Wite an iterator..
- Write unit tests to test functionality... Use the 333 linked list as an example.


- I might have to Implement Hash Tabls in C++.... I could use the 333 Hash Table as an example.  

Graphs
- Write a function to move between Adjacency list representation and AdjMatrix representation. 

- Vertex coloring problem

- Shortest Paths

	- Dijikstra
	- Bellman Ford

Memory
- Write destructors and move constructors etc

Adjacency Matrixhm

Binary Search Tree & Binary Tree
- Finish the implementation of the Binary Tree.. currently it seems sloppy because all operations on the TreeNode.. But I should have a BST
- Write tests to test the implementation .. 

Intervals



Server Project...

- Maybe I should implement a Linked List and a Hash Table with the functionality and then write the entire thing in c++ ... Now there is an idea.  

Algorithms 
Convex Hull
algorithms/leet_code

This is leet_code problem 587 Erect the Fence.  The scenario being using the minimum amount of rope to fence in a certain number of points on a dimensional grid.  This will amount to a convex hull algoritm.


Interview Problems.. 

1) Closest Product
algoriths/arrays 

Good Job ! This seems to have worked... not too difficult.


2) Sum of k largest elements in BST 
- Given a BST, the task is to find the sum of all elements greater than or equal to kth element.. 


3) Find the kth to last element of a singly linked list... 

	- Gayle lachmann whats her so face uses recursion.. 

4) String compression..   
algorithns/leet code
If the newly returned string is longer than the input string, return the original string. 

aaabbdde -> a3b2d2e1 

This looks good


5) Rotate Image

algorithms/leetcode

6) Zero Out				Did this.. 
algorithms/leetcode

- From cracking the coding interview-


7) String Rotation??
algorithms/leet_code



8) Connected Cells... 


LEET CODE PROBLEMS:

-Rotate Image 48
	-I'd imagine there are many different ways to approach this problem.. 


-Rotate String 796
algorithms/leet_code


9) Median of two sorted arrays of different size
algorithms/leetcode
- The solutin for the median of two arrays with different size turns out to be quite a bit more difficult to implement on account of the numerous base cases to consider.
- Solution to this problem with two arrays of same size can either be de one in O(n) time with a merge routine, and a second method in O(nlogn) which compares the medians of two arrays...

I've been a lazy piece of shit today.  Stop it.  Stop it right now...

Line segment intersection.  Determine wether or not 2 line segments denoted (q1,q2) and (p1,p2) intersect.  




algorithms/geometry



BST 

sum of k laregest elements in BST..
I am having trouble linking to this in my algorithms/trees directory... Not sure why.  

I inherited the BinarySearchTree and implemented a function that sums the the largest elements of the BST.  
Does reverse inorder traversal to traverse the right side of the tree.  

In normal inorder traversal of a BST...


Maybe I should review the connected cells problem.  Good example of dynamic programming..


Have I completed All subsets?? Maybe I should... 

I might have to watch some of the recitations... Or return to the Http server... lets do that.  

Maybe my big goal should be implement max flow... MIT 6.046 yea lets do that.. 

First lets get that fucking HEAP to work. 


Flow NEtworks  
Maximum flow




6/15/2018
- Learn about the formulation of the maximum flow proble
- connected components.  Perform BFS and DFS to identify the different components of G. m

Finally got my lazy ass to campus.. 

Write some test cases for the LinkedList
- search for item, remove item.  
- We can do both of these operations recursively and iteratively. 


Binary Search Trees
- Have good performance when they are balanced... whey they are not??
- I might have to implement a balanced binary tree.  

Work on heap sort.  

6/16/2018

- Work on your heap implementation.  
- Heap sort.  

okay do heap sort.  Can i do this inplace or do I have to return a new array?
Okay implemented heap sort that was easy... Now... I seem to have needed a priority queue for several Graph Algorithms... dijikstra and i think Prim's MST


YOU IMPLEMENTED A HEAP WITH DECREASE KEY GOOD JOB YOU DUMB ASS NOW ITS TIME... to commit to github.. work on dijikstra..


Start with the test cases... 


- Determine if a graph has a cycle
- Determine if a graph is connected etc.  

6/18/2018

- Finish Dijkstra... having a little trouble with this at the moment!
- Work on Bellman Ford, Prim & Kruskall.
- Work on some Leet_Code problems
	- 852 Peak Index in a Mountain.  The provided Binary Search algorithm loops infintly!
	- 453 Minimum Moves to equal array elements

6/19/2018

- Write more code, you have been lazy as shit. 


6/20/2018


- YOU GOT DIJIKSTRA TO WORK FUCK YEA!!!
