Worked on the priority queue implementation.. took a working implementation possibly from GeeksForGeeks for ints and wrote to work with templates.  

- Decreaase Key... 
-Priority Queue
	-THis should be high priority since a lot of other algorithms depend on this..



SetUp the test framework.... 

having problems with seg faults of course on my heap.  

haing problems seg faults with the DFS... god damit 

Disjoint Set Union Find
- Implement cycle detection using UnionFind


Linked Lists...

- I inserted Values into the linked List
- Is there a deletion > 
- Merge Lists... 
- Reverse Lists .. 
- Wite an iterator..
- Write unit tests to test functionality... Use the 333 linked list as an example.


- I might have to Implement Hash Tabls in C++.... I could use the 333 Hash Table as an example.  



Graphs
- Write a function to move between Adjacency list representation and AdjMatrix representation. 




Adjacency Matrix

Binary Search Tree & Binary Tree
- 
- Write tests to test the implementation .. 


Server Project...

- Maybe I should implement a Linked List and a Hash Table with the functionality and then write the entire thing in c++ ... Now there is an idea.  





Interview Problems..
