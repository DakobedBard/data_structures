/*

The key idea behind graph traversal is to mark each vertex when we first visit it and keep track of we have not yet completely explored.  

undisovered - vertex is in its initial virgin state

discovered - the vertex has been found but we have not yet checkout out all of its incident edges

processed - the vertex after we have visited all of its incident edges.
